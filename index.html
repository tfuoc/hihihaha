<h1 style="color: red;">BEST 10 WEAPONS COMBINATION IN PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS</h1>
<h3>There's a lot of guns in the game, so how can we make a great combo to reach our victory easily ?<br>These are top 10 combinations in the game:</h3>
<h4>10. <ins>M416 + SLR</ins></h4>	
<img src="\testin\M416-SLR-min.png" height="300px" width="500px">
<p>This is a combination of the stability at mid-range and close range of the M416 and the powerful impact of each shot from the SLR. It is a perfect blend for the early and mid-game, not only because it is easy to find in various areas on the map but also due to the excellent accessories available, such as vertical grips, etc.</p>
<h4>9. <ins>AKM + Mini14</ins></h4>
<img src="acf30-15954838609162-800.avif" height="300px" width="500px">
<p>This is a combination of the Mini14's long-range stability and the AKM's fast firing rate. It is also one of the most trusted pairs, especially among highly skilled players. However, the AKM is not a stable weapon for beginners, so it will take a lot of time to get used to and master this weapon.</p>
<h4>8. <ins>Berry M762 + M24</ins></h4>

<p>Berry M762 is a weapon that has several advantages over the M416, featuring a fast firing rate and moderate stability. As a result, many people favor this gun as their weapon of choice. On the other hand, the M24 is a sniper rifle with high damage output, where just two shots to the head can take you out of the game. This combination is quite convenient since both use the same type of ammunition: 7.62mm.</p>
<h4>7. <ins>AUG + Kar98K</ins></h4>

<p>After emerging from the supply crate, the AUG has become a highly popular weapon on maps like Erangel, Sanhok, and others. With its fast firing rate at close range and decent stability at mid-range, combined with the widely favored Kar98K sniper rifle, this duo is an unstoppable force in the final zones.</p>
<h4>6. <ins>AWM + M416</ins></h4>
<img src="hqdefault.jpg" height="300px" width="500px">
<p>The AWM is a sniper rifle that appears exclusively in supply crates. It is one of the most powerful guns, with the capability for one-hit kills. Therefore, the final zones won’t be too difficult if you have this weapon in your arsenal.</p>
<h4>5. <ins>UMP + M416</ins></h4>  
<img src="Screenshot 2024-08-06 221858.png" height="300px" width="500px">
<p>Unlike other combinations, this duo is only effective at mid-range and closer. The UMP is an SMG with a fast firing rate at close range and extremely high stability. This makes it an excellent pair for attacking buildings and early-game scenarios when you don’t yet have all the appropriate attachments.</p>
<h4>4. <ins>M416 + Mini14</ins></h4> 
<img src="Screenshot 2024-08-06 222249.png" height="300px" width="500px">
<p>This is the perfect combination of stability between the M416 and the Mini14. Additionally, they both use the same 5.56mm ammunition, so they will take up less space in your backpack.</p>
<h4>3. <ins>Groza + AWM</ins></h4> 
<img src="Screenshot 2024-08-06 222646.png" height="300px" width="500px">
<p>The AWM and Groza are both weapons that only appear in supply crates, which makes them highly sought after by other players. Despite the challenge of acquiring them, we can all agree that this is the most dominant duo in the final stages of the game, capable of performing well at both long and close ranges.</p>
<h4>2. <ins>Mk-14 + AWM</ins></h4> 
<img src="Screenshot 2024-08-06 223213.png" height="300px" width="500px">
<p>This is considered an extremely powerful combo when used at mid to long range. The MK14 is a DMR with excellent burst firing capabilities compared to the M416, but it has poorer stability. Therefore, it requires some practice. If you can leverage the strengths of this duo, victory will come to you easily.</p>
<h4>1. <ins>M416 + Kar98k</ins></h4> 
<img src="Screenshot 2024-08-06 223341.png" height="300px" width="500px">
<p>Finally, the M416 and Kar98K are considered the most popular duo in PUBG. With their easy availability across the map and their versatility, this pair is widely favored by players to achieve top 1 finishes, providing an emotional experience throughout the match.</p>
